# README-Generator

## Description

I often find README's long and tedious. I understand the importance of them, but to me they seem like a chore to have to write out every little thing about my project. With this new README generator, anyone who chooses can spend less time on writing out and formatting my README, and more time coding the actual project. As this was my first project with using node.js, I learned quite a lot, especially with the inquirer and fs packages.

## Installation

You will need to have Node.js installed on your computer to run the generator. Then you will need to clone the repository onto your computer. Open up a terminal, navigate to the project, and from there run "npm i" in your terminal. Lastly, run "node index.js" and input all your responses to generate a README. You can find your sample README in the folder named ResponseOutputs.
